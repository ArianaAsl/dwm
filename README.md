# dwm
my minimal build of dwm
dwm archive contains my build of dwm and my .dwm directory which contains my bar configs and autostart stuff. Bar is set with xsetroot. 
JoyPixels fonts and Nerd fonts are required.

for colors in bar you must delete the "iscol" parameter in the C code (which I have done)

xinitrc goes with the startx for all display managements and starting dwm and autostarting most things.

Credit for the alacritty conf goes to dt, I've just removed the bloat and the colors I care for.
